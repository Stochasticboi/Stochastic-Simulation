# Problem Sets

This directory contains problem sets from the PhD course on Stochastic Simulation.

## Structure

Each problem set is organized in its own subdirectory:
- `problem_set_1/` - First problem set
- `problem_set_2/` - Second problem set
- etc.

## Problem Set Format

Each problem set directory should contain:
- `problems.md` or `problems.pdf` - The problem statement(s)
- `README.md` - Overview and any additional notes
- Any supporting files (data, scripts, etc.)

## Working on Problems

1. Navigate to the specific problem set directory
2. Read the problem statement
3. Create your solution files (code, notebooks, reports, etc.)
4. Reference the `/solutions` directory for completed work
